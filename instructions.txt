Instructions for Snake Game AI

1. The game uses an AI agent to control the snake.
2. The snake repeatedly plays the game, trying to improve its performance over time.
3. A separate window displays a graph showing the performance of the AI agent, illustrating how it improves with each iteration.
4. The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or its own body, but the AI agent will start a new game immediately after.
5. To run the game, execute the `Agent.py` file.
